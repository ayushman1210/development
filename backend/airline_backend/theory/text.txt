we need to build a backend system that can support  different feature for an airline company
end user is going to be someone 
--> book flight 
-->query about flight

future user should be able to search for the return flights and multi city flights 
user should be able to the class of the flights 
user should be able to request and book for extra luggage 
able to select no of the seats 
list down the flights 
we should show user the best flight based on the price

pagination that we can list chunk of flights at one point of time 
// we can add support for more filter

tracking flight prices and user notified on any price drops 
user can maake dummy payment 
user able to lsit previous and upcomming flights

coupons for discount and offers 
while making a booking person can reserve than one seat with one login id 


non functionsl requirement 
we are going to have more flight serch than flight bookings
system need to be accurate in term of booking 
except that we will be approx 100000 total user 
so in one day we can except 2000 bookings 
system should be capable of scaling up to 3x to current extimated price 
concurrency should be handles using rdbms should be good solution 

capacity estimation 
storage estimates--> 5 years 4000000 booking 200000 users considering all the user record and
booking records take 10mb of data the overall data is around 1TB of memory for our intial 
pilot run 
traffic estimates--> if we consider 15:1 booking ratio then at max around 30000 query a day 


search and flight services 
create flight
delete flight
update flight 
search for flight 
pagination
